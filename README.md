Calender App"
 I created a small calender with real time
 the thought process was ... I really love using calender in real life and i'm sure this be useful in work place

HTML
 So first i made sure i had my foundation and my thought process of what i wanted to create which was the calender in html i wanted to add the month,day,year and put that all into a container(calender conatain)

 CSS
 So this process was to form it what i envisioned far as the style. The background and how i wanted it to be in its own container block. and i played with the colors,font,sizing also

 JS

 I started console logging everything  by elementID. then i wanted it to generate the current time,date,month,year
 with saving the data along the way.
